Anyone who has held a helium balloon knows that if you release the balloon, it will rise up into the air; or that if you put a rock into water, it will sink. It’s also true that if you <a href=\"http://youtu.be/t1Hv0Oz_r1k?t=33s\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://youtu.be/t1Hv0Oz_r1k?t=33s\">put lead on liquid mercury</a>, it will float. Whether something sinks or floats in a fluid depends on the buoyancy of the object in the surrounding medium.</p><p>In this lab, you will investigate buoyancy by placing objects into fluids. You will measure how much fluid is displaced and observe whether the object floats or sinks.</p></div><div style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 12px;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 12px;\"><div style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;\">Density, Displacement, and Archimedes</div><p>Archimedes, the great mathematician and scientist, was once challenged to prove whether or not the King’s crown was made out of solid gold. In an ingenious experiment, he proposed a test to measure the density of the crown and then to determine whether the density of the crown matched the expected density of gold (19.3 g/mL).</p><p>The density, <em>ρ</em>, is defined as the mass, <em>m</em>, per volume, <em>V</em>, of an object. In mathematical terms:</p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\">Equation 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_1_1.png\" alt=\"buoy_eq_1_1\" title=\"buoy_eq_1_1\" height=\"56\" width=\"63\" data-mce-src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_1_1.png\"></p><p>For a simple object, such as a block or a sphere, calculating the volume of the object is trivial. However, it’s very difficult to calculate the volume of an irregularly shaped object, such as a crown.</p><p>In what came to be known as <em>Archimedes’ Principle</em>, Archimedes noticed that if you submerge an object in water, the volume of the object equals the volume of the displaced water. This is true regardless of the material that the object is made of. A hollow ball of filled with air and a solid ball made of lead with the same volumes will displace the same amount of water when submerged.</p><p>Archimedes placed the crown in a tub of water and measured how much the water rose up; he used this displacement to calculate the volume of the crown. He could then measure the mass of the crown and apply Equation 1 to find the volume. Using this procedure, he was able to show that the crown was not made of solid gold.</p><div style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;\">Buoyant Force</div><p>To understand whether an object will sink or float, we must first understand buoyancy. As you go deeper down into a fluid, the pressure you feel increases. This is due to gravity; the deeper you go, the more the mass of the fluid above presses down on you.</p><p>Near the surface of the ocean, the pressure is low because there isn’t much water pushing down on you. On the other hand, consider the <a href=\"http://www.marianatrench.com/\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.marianatrench.com/\">Mariana Trench</a>. At 10 km below the surface, it is the deepest part of the Earth's oceans. The pressure of water on a mass at the bottom of the Trench is over 1,000 times the atmospheric pressure. Submarines that travel to these deep ocean depths are specially designed to withstand incredible pressures.</p><p>Not only does pressure increase as an object is submerged deeper into a fluid, but if the object is held still, then the pressure acts equally in all directions at any given depth (i.e. the force pushing down equals the force pushing left, etc.). If the pressure does not act equally, there would be net movement in the fluid.</p><p>Now consider the diagram below, depicting a block submerged in water (which is one type of fluid). The arrows and their sizes indicate the relative pressure.</p><p><img src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/.resized_200x232_submarine_pressure.png\" alt=\"submarine_pressure\" title=\"submarine_pressure\" height=\"232\" width=\"200\" data-mce-src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/.resized_200x232_submarine_pressure.png\"></p><p>In this example, the block causes a net displacement of water equal to its volume (regardless of the material). Notice that the forces acting on the block from the left and right cancel each other out.</p><p>On the other hand, the pressure pushing up on the object is greater than the pressure pushing down on the object. This difference in pressure results in a net upward force, called the <em>buoyant force</em>. The buoyant force is independent of the density of the object on which it acts.</p><p>As you submerge an object, you must displace a volume of fluid equal to the volume of the submerged object. Functionally, this causes the fluid to rise up against gravity. The force required to lift this mass of fluid, m<sub>f</sub>, is equal to the buoyant force and is given by the expression:</p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\">Equation 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_2.png\" alt=\"buoy_eq_2\" title=\"buoy_eq_2\" height=\"31\" width=\"108\" data-mce-src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_2.png\"></p><p>It is convenient to consider the density of the fluid, ρ<sub>f</sub>, and substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2 to get an expression for the buoyant force:</p><p><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\">Equation 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_3_1.png\" alt=\"buoy_eq_3_1\" title=\"buoy_eq_3_1\" height=\"31\" width=\"138\" data-mce-src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_3_1.png\"><br><em>where V is the volume of&nbsp;</em><em>displaced&nbsp;</em><em>fluid.</em></p><p>The density of water is 1 g/mL.

When an object of mass m<sub>o</sub> is submerged in a fluid, the force of gravity (F<sub>g</sub>) pulls the object downward while the buoyant force pushes the object upward. The <em>net force</em> acting on the object is given by:</p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\">Equation 4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_4_of_submerged_block.png\" alt=\"buoy_eq_4_of_submerged_block\" title=\"buoy_eq_4_of_submerged_block\" height=\"31\" width=\"123\" data-mce-src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_4_of_submerged_block.png\"></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"color: #000066;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #000066;\">Measuring the Mass of Blocks</strong></p><p>In Experiment 1, you will be using the apparatus to measure the buoyant force directly (if you have done our Torque lab, this apparatus will look familiar.) The apparatus consists of a meter stick suspended from a string at a pivot point. By adding mass to one side of the stick, you will be applying a force, <em>F</em>, at a distance L from the pivot point, creating a torque, τ, given by the following expression:</p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\">Equation 5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_5.png\" alt=\"buoy_eq_5\" title=\"buoy_eq_5\" height=\"23\" width=\"88\" data-mce-src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_5.png\"></p><p>This torque will cause the meter stick to rotate. To return the meter stick to its equilibrium position (i.e. its position before the mass was added) you must apply an equal and opposite torque to the other side of the meter stick. You can do this by adding either one mass or multiple masses, as long as the torque on one side of the meter stick equals the torque on the other side of the meter stick.</p><p>If you have several masses, m<sub>1</sub>, …, m<sub>n</sub> that are placed at different distances from the pivot point, L<sub>1</sub>, …,L<sub>n</sub>, then the net torque, τ<sub>net</sub> will be given by:</p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\">Equation 6:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/.resized_350x36_buoy_eq_6.png\" alt=\"buoy_eq_6\" title=\"buoy_eq_6\" height=\"36\" width=\"350\" data-mce-src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/.resized_350x36_buoy_eq_6.png\"></p><p>This is how the scale in a doctor’s office works. When you step on the scale, the balance tips. You then move a large mass&nbsp;—&nbsp;the coarse adjustment&nbsp;— to balance the scale (i.e. you move the mass to a defined distance from the pivot point). After you've used your large mass as a coarse adjustment, you use a smaller mass to do the fine adjustment (i.e. moving the masses to different lengths from the pivot point). You move the masses until the torque due to the masses equals the torque due to your weight.</p><p>In this lab, you will first measure the mass of a block by placing the block on one side of the meter stick, and will then add masses to the other side of the meter stick to get an equal but opposite torque (i.e. balance the meter stick). If the block with mass m<sub>Block</sub> is hung a distance L<sub>Block</sub> from the pivot point, then the torque due to the block, τ<sub>Block</sub> is equal to:</p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\">Equation 7:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_7.png\" alt=\"buoy_eq_7\" title=\"buoy_eq_7\" height=\"29\" width=\"220\" data-mce-src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_7.png\"></p><p>If you balance the system when you add two masses to the other side of the meter stick&nbsp;—&nbsp;m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;at distances L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>&nbsp; away from the pivot point, the total torque is equal to:</p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\">Equation 8:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_8.png\" alt=\"buoy_eq_8\" title=\"buoy_eq_8\" height=\"29\" width=\"267\" data-mce-src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_8.png\"></p><p>Now that the system is at equilibrium, we can equate Equations 7 and 8 to solve for the mass of the blockt:</p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\">Equation 9:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_9.png\" alt=\"buoy_eq_9\" title=\"buoy_eq_9\" height=\"63\" width=\"233\" data-mce-src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_9.png\"></p><p><br></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"color: #000066;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #000066;\">Measuring the Buoyant Force of the Density of Fluids</strong></p><p>You can now find the buoyant force by placing the block in a fluid. Recall that liquids and gasses are both fluids; a fluid is something that flows. However, while both take on the shape of their containers, liquids, unlike gasses, do not expand to fill their containers.</p><p>In both fluid situations in our lab&nbsp;—&nbsp;when the block is submerged in liquid water and when it is suspended in gaseous air&nbsp;—&nbsp;you measure F <sub>net</sub>. You will find that when the block is submerged in a liquid, its mass will be less than when it is in air. This difference is due to the buoyant force.</p><p>When the block is in air, the buoyant force is negligible and F<sub>net</sub> is (space inserted) approximately equal to F<sub>g</sub>. When the block is submerged, the net force is given by Equation 4:</p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\"><img src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_4_of_submerged_block.png\" alt=\"buoy_eq_4_of_submerged_block\" title=\"buoy_eq_4_of_submerged_block\" height=\"31\" width=\"123\" data-mce-src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_4_of_submerged_block.png\"></p><p>To measure the net force acting on the block when it is submerged (F<sub>net</sub> in Equation 4), you repeat the same procedure to balance the torques, measuring F<sub>net</sub> instead of the force due to gravity.</p><p>Thus, if you measure F<sub>g</sub> when an object isn't submerged, and then F<sub>net</sub> when submerged, you can get a measurement of the buoyant force. If you know the volume of fluid displaced, you can also use Equation 4 to get the density of the fluid:</p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\">Equation 10:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_10_1.png\" alt=\"buoy_eq_10_1\" title=\"buoy_eq_10_1\" height=\"61\" width=\"190\" data-mce-src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_10_1.png\"></p><p>If we want to determine whether an object will sink or float, we can use Equation 1 to express the mass of the object as a having density, ρ<sub>o</sub> and a volume <em>v</em> (equal to the volume of the fluid displaced!). Thus, Equation 4 becomes:</p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\">Equation 11:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_11_1.png\" alt=\"buoy_eq_11_1\" title=\"buoy_eq_11_1\" height=\"31\" width=\"426\" data-mce-src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_11_1.png\"></p><p>Remembering that a force is directed upward is given a positive sign, we can use Equation 11 to determine whether an object will:</p><ul><li>float: go up because F<sub>net</sub> is positive</li><li>sink: go down because F<sub>net</sub> is negative</li>or<li>stay: remain in one place because F<sub>net</sub> is zero</li></ul><p>This depends on the difference between the densities of the fluid and the object. If the fluid is denser than the object, the object will float. If the object is denser than the fluid, it will sink. We can now understand why the helium balloon floats: the density of helium is less than the density of air.</p><p>Another fascinating implication of this equation is that an object submerged in fluid will weigh less than it does out of the fluid because the buoyant force will always act opposing gravity.</p><p>(Note: If the object sinks to the bottom of the container, it is not being held at equilibrium due to the buoyant force. In this case, electrostatic interactions prevent the block from going all the way through the container. To describe the net force in this case, we will need a different equation than Equation 11. Equation 11 is true if the only forces acting on the object are 1) gravity and 2) the buoyant force.)</p><p>A submarine capitalizes on these principles to float or remain submerged. It has ballast tanks, which can be filled with either water or air. To dive, the submarine fills the ballast tanks with water, causing its density to become similar to the density of the water. Its mass increases while its volume remains the same. To surface, the submarine forces air into the ballast tanks, causing the density of the submarine to decrease and the submarine to rise up. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBvYJAROLDU\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBvYJAROLDU\">This video</a> shows a model of how ballast tanks work.</p><p>Why does a boat remain partially submerged rather than completely afloat on the surface of the water? This occurs because air can act as a fluid with a set density. The boat will rise up until the density of the boat equals the average density of the fluids surrounding it.</p><p>Equation 11 still holds in the case of air acting as a fluid and an object rising or sinking in water until F<sub>net</sub> is equal to zero. If an object is at equilibrium and not completely submerged, then F<sub>net</sub> = 0. (Recall, this will only work if the object does not sink to the bottom.) In this case, the volume of fluid displaced by the object, V<sub>f</sub>, will not equal the total volume of the object, v<sub>o</sub>, since the entire object is not submerged.</p><p>Thus, Equation 11 becomes:</p><p><br></p><table class=\"mce-item-table\" style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; color: black; empty-cells: show; orphans: 3; widows: 3; padding: 2px; font-size: 10px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; color: black; empty-cells: show; orphans: 3; widows: 3; padding: 2px; font-size: 10px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td></tr></tbody></table><p>+++ &nbsp;+ ha!&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\">Equation 12:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_12_1.png\" alt=\"buoy_eq_12_1\" title=\"buoy_eq_12_1\" height=\"31\" width=\"302\" data-mce-src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_12_1.png\"></p><p>We can rearrange this equation to see that:</p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\" data-mce-style=\"text-align: center; font-family: Arial; color: black;\">Equation 13:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_13_1.png\" alt=\"buoy_eq_13_1\" title=\"buoy_eq_13_1\" height=\"65\" width=\"120\" data-mce-src=\"http://dev.latenitelabs.com/lms/assets/IMAGES/LabTextImages/buoy_eq_13_1.png\"></p><p>Therefore, by measuring the water displaced, one can measure the density of the object.
