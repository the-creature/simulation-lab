<p>Welcome to the Late Nite Labs chemistry lab simulation. If this is your first time here, this lab activity will help you become familiar with the way things work in the lab.</p>
<p><span>Have you ever wondered what you can do with the instruments and materials in the virtual chemistry lab (<strong>Figure 1</strong>)? What experiments can you perform</span><span> and how </span><span>you</span><span> can obtain different colors</span><span>? </span><span>There is a large variety of experiments you can perform in the chemistry lab. You can react different sub</span><span>stances to obtain new substances, you can determine the content of a substance in a sample, or you can study different properties of substances.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The colors of the solutions used in experiments depend on the composition of the substances present in the solution, their structures, as well as the oxidation states of the different atoms present. </span><span>Throughout your class</span><span>,</span><span> you will get to experience a variety of colors during your experiments. </span><span>You will perform quantitative and qualitative observations.</span></p>
<h3>Looking Around the Lab</h3>
<p>Welcome <span>inside our</span> virtual chemistry lab. <span>Because </span>this is the first lab you are doing, we<span> woul</span>d like to take a little time to show you around.</p>
<p>You are reading this text in the Lab Manual that is overlaid next to the lab itself. To create more space in the lab, you can close the lab manual at any point. To reopen the lab manual click the <strong>Show Lab Manual</strong> icon in the lower left corner of the lab.</p>
<p>This lab manual has three parts to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Background</strong> has an explanation of the topics covered in this lab along with some of the rules and formulas that you will need to complete the assignments. <span>R</span>ead the Background first.</li>
<li>The <strong>Procedures</strong> are the steps you need to follow to complete the experiments.</li>
<li>The <strong>Lab Notes</strong> is where you record what you do and the results you obtain while performing the experiments in the laboratory. The procedures tell you to record things as you go, but make sure you understand what you are doing and record anything you may need to refer to later when you do the assignments. The Lab Manual with your notes is always available to you after exit<span>ing</span> the lab.</li>
</ul>
<p>The laboratory work area is the <span>black</span> counter-top called the workbench.</p>
<p>All of your lab supplies are available to you on the shelf on the wall above the workbench. It is actually three shelves in one, which are selected by clicking the three tabs underneath the shelf. The three shelves are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Containers (test tubes, beakers, etc.)</li>
<li>Materials (chemicals, plants, etc.)</li>
<li>Instruments (thermometers, balances, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>It<span> i</span>s easy to <span>obtain </span>what you need. Just click on a shelf tab, then click on the item on the shelf and drag it down to the workbench. Release the item wherever you want to place it. There is an unlimited supply of everything, as many test tubes as you need, even multiple thermometers and pH meters, so do n<span>o</span>t worry about running out of equipment or materials.</p>
<p>There<span> i</span>s really just one rule to manipulating things in the lab, and it is...</p>
<h3>Everything Revolves Around Containers!</h3>
<p>This means that materials go into containers, and instruments are connected to containers to measure and manipulate the properties of those containers and their contents.</p>
<h3>About This Lab</h3>
<p><span>Now that you<span> a</span><span>re familiar with the lab environment, you can</span><span>&nbsp;get started with a couple of experiments.&nbsp;</span>In this lab, you will perform two experiments to </span><span>familiarize yourself with our virtual lab environment. In the first experiment, you will perform an acid&ndash;base reaction and observe any changes indicating a reaction has happened. In the second experiment, you will measure the change in </span><span>the </span><span>pressure of</span> <span>a gas (air) trapped in a flask as a function of volume. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
